    "# ServerSim Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "*This document is a Jupyter notebook.  See http://jupyter.org/ for more information on Jupyter notebooks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an overview of ***[ServerSim](https://github.com/pvillela/ServerSim)***, a framework for the creation of discrete event simulation models to analyze the performance, throughput, and scalability of services deployed on computer servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ServerSim is a small framework based on ***[SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html)***, a well-known discrete-event simulation framework written in the ***Python*** language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader should have at least cursory familiarity with Python and SimPy in order to follow the technical details in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is well-suited to this kind of application due to its rapid development dynamic language characteristics and the availability of powerful libraries relevant for this kind of work.  In addition to SimPy, we will use portions of ***SciPy***, a powerful set of libraries for efficient data analysis and visualization that includes *Matplotlib*, which will be used for plotting graphs in our tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "ServerSim consists of a several classes and utilities.  The main classes are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### class Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Represents a server -- physical, VM, or container, with a predetermined computation capacity.  A server can execute arbitrary service request types.  The computation capacity of a server is represented in terms of a number of hardware threads and a total speed number (computation units processed per unit of time).  The total speed is equally apportioned among the hardware threads, to give the speed per hardware thread.  A server also has a number of associated software threads (which must be no smaller than the number of hardware threads).  Software threads are relevant for blocking computations only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations in this document assume non-blocking services, so the software threads will not be of consequence in the tutorial example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "- *env*: SimPy Environment, used to start and end simulations, and used internally by SimPy to control simulation events.\n",
    "- *max_concurrency*: The maximum of _hardware threads for the server.\n",
    "- *num_threads*: The maximum number of software threads for the server.\n",
    "- *speed*: Aggregate server speed across all _hardware threads.\n",
    "- *name*: The server's name.\n",
    "- *hw_svc_req_log*: If not None, a list where hardware\n",
    "    service requests will be logged.  Each log entry is a\n",
    "    triple (\"hw\", name, svc_req), where name is this server's\n",
    "    name and svc_req is the current service request asking for\n",
    "    hardware resources.\n",
    "- *sw_svc_req_log*: If not None, a list where software thread\n",
    "    service requests will be logged.  Each log entry is a\n",
    "    triple (\"sw\", name, svc_req), where name is this server's\n",

    "    software thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### class SvcRequest\n",
    "\n",
    "A request for execution of computation units on one or more servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service request submission is implemented as a SimPy Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service request can be a composite of sub-requests.\n",
    "A service request that is part of a composite has an attribute that\n",
    "is a reference to its parent service request.  In addition,\n",
    "such a composition is implemented through the *gen* attribute of the\n",
    "service request, which is a generator.  That generator can yield service\n",
    "request submissions for other service requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a service request is non-blocking, i.e., a thread is\n",
    "held on the target server only while the service request itself\n",
    "is executing; the thread is relinquished when the request\n",
    "finishes executing and it passes control to its sub-requests.\n",
    "However, blocking service requests can be modeled as well (see the\n",
    "*Blkg* class).\n",

    "Attributes:\n",
    "- *env*: The SimPy Environment.\n",

    "    is part of a composite service request.  None othersise.\n",
    "- *svc_name*: Name of the service this request is associated with.\n",
    "- *gen*: Generator which defines the behavior of this request.  The\n",
    "    generator produces an iterator which yields simpy.Event\n",
    "    instances.  The submit() method wratps the iterator in a\n",
    "    simpy.Process object to schedule the request for execution\n",
    "    by SimPy..\n",

    "- *in_val*: Optional input value of the request.\n",
    "- *in_blocking_call*: Indicates whether this request is\n",
    "    in the scope of a blocking call.  When this parameter\n",
    "    is true, the service request will hold a software\n",
    "    thread on the target server while the service\n",
    "    request itself and any of its sub-requests (calls\n",
    "    to other servers) are executing.  Otherwise, the\n",
    "    call is non-blocking, so a thread is held on the\n",
    "    target server only while the service request itself\n",
    "    is executing; the thread is relinquished when\n",
    "    this request finishes executing and it passes control\n",
    "    to its sub-requests.\n",
    "- *out_val*: Output value produced from in_val by the service\n",
    "    execution.  None by default.\n",
